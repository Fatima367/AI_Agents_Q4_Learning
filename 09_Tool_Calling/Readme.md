# Guide to Tool Calling / Function Calling in Agentic AI

Welcome to the world of **Agentic AI**! If you’re new to this space, you might have heard terms like **Tool Calling** or **Function Calling**. Don’t worry — they sound technical, but they’re actually pretty easy to grasp.

This guide will explain what they are, why they matter, and how you can get started.

## 🔧 What is Tool Calling / Function Calling?
**Tool Calling** (also called **Function Calling**) is when an AI uses external tools or code to perform a task it can't do by itself.

### Think of it like this:
> The AI is smart, but sometimes it needs help — like a calculator to do math, or a weather API to check the forecast.

So it “calls” a **tool** (like an API, script, or function) to get the job done.

## 🤖 Why is This Important in Agentic AI?

Agentic AI is about building **autonomous agents** that can think, decide, and act. Tool calling lets these agents:

  * 🔌 **Extend their skills** (e.g., access data, perform actions)

  * 🧠 **Reason better** (e.g., combine logic + tools)

  * ⚙️ **Automate tasks** (e.g., send emails, query databases)

Without tool calling, AI agents are stuck in their own heads. With it, they can interact with the real world.

## 🛠️ How Tool Calling Works (Step-by-Step)

### 1. You ask the AI something
> Example: “What’s 25 × 17?”

### 2. The AI realizes it needs a tool
It decides, “I should use a calculator.”

### 3. The AI makes a tool/function call
> Example: multiply(25, 17)

### 4. The tool gives a result
> Returns: 425

### 5. The AI replies
> Says: “25 × 17 = 425”

✅ The AI didn’t do the math itself — it **used a tool.**

## 🔑 Key Terms
| **Term** | **Meaning** |
|------|----------|
| **Tool** | An external service or code the AI can use (e.g., weather API, function)
| **Function Call**	| A specific type of tool call that runs a code function
| **Agentic AI** | AI agents that act autonomously to achieve goals using tools and logic


## 🌍 Real-World Examples
Tool calling lets AI agents do things like:

- 📅 Schedule meetings with a calendar API

- 🌤 Get real-time weather with an API

- 📊 Analyze spreadsheets using code

- 📰 Fetch news headlines from news APIs

- 🧮 Solve math using a calculator function

## 🧪 How to Try Tool Calling Yourself (Using OpenAI Agents SDK)
Want to build your own tool-using AI agent? Here's how to get started using the **OpenAI Agents SDK** — the official way to build agentic AI with GPT-4 and GPT-4o or Google Gemini.

### 1. 🧠 Use the OpenAI Agents SDK
Start with the [OpenAI Python SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-python), which now includes full support for assistants, threads, and tool calling.

Install it:
```
uv add openai
``` 
Then use OpenAI's `Assistants` and `Threads` system to create agents that can call your Python functions.

### 2. 🌤 Start Small — Create a Simple Tool (e.g., Weather)

Write a basic function like:

```
def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    # Fake example
    weather = {
        "paris": "Sunny, 22°C",
        "london": "Rainy, 15°C"
    }
    return weather.get(city.lower(), "Weather not found.")
```

Then register this function as a tool in your assistant.

### 3. 🧪 Build and Run the Agent

Use the SDK to:

- Define your assistant and tool schema

- Start a conversation (thread)

- Let the assistant automatically decide when to call the tool

👉 See [OpenAI’s Agents SDK Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) for detailed steps.

### 4. 🔗 Add More Tools Over Time
Once you're comfortable:

- Add other tools (e.g., `send_email`, `calculate`, `query_db`)

- Chain tools together to solve bigger tasks

- Use the `tool_choice="auto"` option to let the assistant decide what to call


### ✅ Example Tools to Try
Here are ideas for simple tools to practice with:

| **Tool Idea** | **What It Does** |
|---------------|--------------|
| `get_weather(city)` |	Returns fake or real weather data |
| `multiply(a, b)` | Multiplies two numbers |
| `get_news(topic)` | Simulates fetching headlines |
| `convert_currency()` | Converts between currencies |

### 🔐 No API? No Problem
You don’t need real external APIs at first — just use simple Python functions. Later, you can integrate with APIs like:

- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

- [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)

- [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)

### 🛠️ Summary
Using the **OpenAI Agents SDK**, you can give AI-powered assistants access to your own tools and functions. This is the heart of **tool calling** — the assistant decides when and how to use those tools.

Start simple, explore safely, and build your agent's toolbox one function at a time. 🔧✨

## ❓ Common Questions
#### Q: Is tool calling the same as function calling?
A: Function calling is a type of tool calling — usually calling code directly. Tool calling can also involve external services like APIs.

### Q: Do I need to code to use tool calling?
A: A little coding helps, but some platforms provide no-code or low-code options too.

## 🚀 Final Thoughts
Tool Calling is like giving your AI agent a **toolbox** to solve real-world problems. It’s one of the key building blocks of powerful, practical **Agentic AI**.

Start small, play with simple APIs or functions, and build up your skills. Before long, you’ll be creating smart AI agents that can **think, act, and do.**

**Happy building! 🛠️**
